![alt Trivia]( "Trivia game")

This project was developed by a team of 5 people with the aim of building a question and answer game based on the Trivia game, using React and Redux. Each hit gives the player points which are tallied into a scoreboard and displayed in the app. After 5 questions answered, the user is redirected to a score screen, where the number of correct answers and their score will be displayed. At the end of each game, the user can access the leaderboard with the best scores. Each question has 30 seconds to be answered, if the time runs out, the buttons are disabled and the next question is displayed.
